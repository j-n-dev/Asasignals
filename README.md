# Asasignals
[PL: Asasemafory] Signal graphics replacement for OpenTTD, in OpenGFX2 style

# Installation
1. Install NML (I'm not going over this)
2. Open a command prompt in the root directory
3. Run ``nmlc --grf asasignals.grf asasignals.nml``
4. Copy the resulting GRF file into ``Documents/OpenTTD/newgrf/`` (or equivalent directory)
TODO: introduce some sort of make system to make this process less painful

# Credits
- Zephyris (programming help; some artistic guidance)
- Whoever made the original semaphore graphics
- Simon Foster (original signal sprites that I based my designs on)

# Licence notes

This project uses modified versions of certain art assets from the OpenGFX free graphics baseset project. Changes include realignment of sprites and replacement of signal warning boards with my own designs. Link: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenGFX
