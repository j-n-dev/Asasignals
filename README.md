# Notice
This project has been discontinued. I'd like to apologise to everyone who had the misfortune of looking at my horrid abominations.

# Credits (and apologies)
- Zephyris (programming help; some artistic guidance)
- Whoever made the original OpenGFX semaphore graphics
- Simon Foster (original signal sprites that I based my designs on)
